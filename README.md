# Distributed Primality Tester
This is a distributed system written from scratch using sockets to create a TCP server and uses a client-server model.
The server provides numbers to be tested for primality and the clients are responsible for calculating this characteristic
of the number. 

The Primality test is done using Fermat's Little Theorem.
